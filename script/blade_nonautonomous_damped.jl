# identifies which direction is constrained in the model.

# list of excitation frequencies used to excite the system. 
# A parametrisation is performed for each frequency so 
# avoid using more thatn 1 or 2 frequencies
Ω_list = [1.0]
# For the moment we have modal-proportional forcing. 
# k_modes is a vector with length equal to the number of 
# excitation frequencies. For each frequency, a list of modes
# used to define the excitation forcing is reported.
# For instance, for the first excitation
# frequency Ω_list[i] the system is excited with a forcing vector
# defined by the combination of κ_modes[i] modes, wighted by the 
# load multipliers defined in κ_list[i], i.e.:
# F = sum_{j = 1}^{n_frequencies} M κ_modes[i][j]*κ_list[i][j]
# the phase of the input force is given by κ_phase. 'c' stands for cosine,
# while 's' stands for sine.
